## BYI

We are not good at interacting first so if you want to talk feel free to whisper .ᐟ C+H is always appreciated even when not in name unless on DNIUC or we say otherwise .ᐟ our pronouns and name change depends on whose fronting but what's shown is generally fine with anyone .ᐟ someones littles front or we agere and that impacts how we interact with others .ᐟ ***Freminet is our special interest and has been for years*** *we often have trouble thinking and talking about anything but him* .ᐟ  we block *very easily* when it comes to Freminet even if it's so much as a headcanon or pony of him we don't like don't take it to heart.

We love to talk about anything related to Freminet so feel free to ask us about headcanons, ships, theories, ectect !! if you have a favorite character we'd love to share what we think he'd think of them, our favorite Freminet ships at this moment is ***Fairytalelove*** (Freminet x Fischl), Taintedcross (Freminet x Dahlia), and Deathskiss (Freminet x 15zai from BSD), we also have a BUNNCH of aus about him!!
